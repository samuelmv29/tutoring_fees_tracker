# tuition-data-recorder
This program records dates of the tuitions attended. PLEASE READ THE README FILE!

In my community, one issue that kept coming up was how there was no proper recording of dates on which the student attends tuition classes.... as a result there are arguments and even teachers ask for fees earlier than usual. 

Since tuition teachers dont keep proper record of dates, then its expect of a student to do so. However, most of the times the student forgets. 

To solve this issue I made a program which opens immediately when we open our computer(that is everyday) and it asks the customer which tuition he/she is attending that day. After they click on which tuitions they are attending, the date gets automatically recorded in an excel file. 

This program gives an automatic notification when its time to pay fees!!
